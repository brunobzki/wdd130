    <h2>Brunito</h2>
    <p>My name is Bruno Panzacchi, but they call me Brunito.</p>
    <p> I am heading to the information technology career.</p>
    <p>I used to be an auto mechanic and it is still my passion and hobby.</p>
    <p>I am married to a wonderful daughter of God named Carol Nacher.</p>
    <p>We have a beautiful family of 6 members and we are expecting our 5th child.</p>
    <p>This year I have turned my professional career towards software, for 6 months I have been working as a QA tester in a software company.
    <p>I wish to have my bachelor's degree to continue progressing in this IT world.</p>
    <p>I am the third generation member of the church in my family.</p>
